      <h2>Origin Story</h2>
      <p>It all began in a gritty alley of New York City. On a stormy, cold night, as Mrs. Wong was closing up her stand, a stranger approached, asking if he could still get a bowl of hot soup. Despite the late hour, Mrs. Wong reignited the fire and prepared a fresh bowl of soup for him. Grateful, the stranger took his soup and went on his way. Three days later, he returned, craving more of the soup he claimed was better than his own motherâ€™s recipe. He declared it the best soup he had ever tasted! And so, the legend of Mrs. Wong's FAMOUS FOOD was born.</p>        <!-- About page code here -->
